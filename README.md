## 📌 Overview

SmartPPE AI is an intelligent Computer Vision system designed to monitor Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance in industrial environments.

The system analyzes workers in images and determines whether they are:

🟢 Fully Compliant (Full PPE Kit)

🟡 Partially Compliant (Missing PPE Items)

🔴 Non-Compliant (No PPE Detected)

Using YOLOv8 object detection and PPE association logic, SmartPPE can automatically identify workers and verify the presence of mandatory safety equipment.

## 🚨 Industry Problem

Industrial accidents frequently occur because workers fail to wear required PPE.

Common challenges include:

* Manual safety inspections
* Human monitoring errors
* Large workforce management
* Real-time compliance tracking
* Missing critical PPE components

Organizations require automated monitoring solutions to improve worker safety and reduce compliance violations.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Build an AI-powered PPE compliance detection system capable of:

* Detecting workers in images
* Detecting PPE equipment
* Mapping PPE items to individuals
* Identifying missing PPE components
* Generating compliance reports
* Visualizing safety status using color-coded bounding boxes

# 🔍 Detection Pipeline

### Step 1

Detect all objects using YOLOv8.

### Step 2

Separate:

* Person objects
* PPE objects

### Step 3

Associate PPE items with detected workers using IoU matching.

### Step 4

Verify required PPE checklist.

### Step 5

Generate worker-level compliance report.

### Step 6

Draw compliance status on image.
